# Incremental Development

This chapter explores how features can be developed incrementally while maintaining quality and compatibility.

## Principles

Incremental development allows features to evolve based on real-world feedback while minimizing risk.

### Key Principles

- **Start small**: Begin with a minimal viable implementation
- **Iterate based on feedback**: Use nightly testing to gather input
- **Maintain compatibility**: Plan for backward compatibility from the start
- **Document early**: Keep documentation in sync with implementation

## Benefits

### For Feature Authors

- Get early feedback on design choices
- Adjust direction based on real usage
- Build confidence gradually
- Reduce risk of large-scale changes after stabilization

### For the Community

- Try features early and provide feedback
- Influence feature design while it's still flexible
- Understand feature evolution over time
- Build against unstable features when needed

## Challenges

- Balancing stability with iteration
- Managing breaking changes on nightly
- Coordinating specification with implementation
- Setting clear expectations about feature stability
