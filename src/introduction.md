# Introduction

This book is developing a proposal for a staged development process for Rust that integrates incremental development plus specification work.

## Purpose

The goal of this proposal is to establish a clear and structured approach to feature development in Rust that balances:

- **Incremental development**: Allowing features to be developed and tested in stages
- **Specification work**: Ensuring that features are properly specified and documented
- **Community involvement**: Providing opportunities for feedback and iteration

## Scope

This proposal covers the process for developing new features in the Rust language, including:

- How features progress through different stages
- What requirements must be met at each stage
- How specification work integrates with implementation
- How feedback is gathered and incorporated

## License

This work is dual-licensed under MIT OR Apache-2.0, following the same licensing as the Rust project itself.
