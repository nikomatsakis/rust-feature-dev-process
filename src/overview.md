# Overview

This chapter provides a high-level overview of the proposed Rust feature development process.

## Current State

Currently, Rust features are developed through RFCs (Request for Comments) and implementation work. However, the process can be improved to better integrate specification work and incremental development.

## Proposed Approach

The proposed process introduces stages that features progress through, with clear criteria for advancement at each stage. This allows for:

- Early experimentation and feedback
- Iterative refinement based on real-world usage
- Progressive stabilization as confidence grows
- Clear documentation and specification requirements

## Benefits

- **Clarity**: Developers and users understand where a feature is in its lifecycle
- **Flexibility**: Features can be developed incrementally while maintaining quality
- **Quality**: Specification requirements ensure features are well-documented
- **Community**: Multiple opportunities for feedback and involvement
