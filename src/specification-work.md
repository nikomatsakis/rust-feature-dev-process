# Specification Work

This chapter discusses how specification work integrates with feature development.

## Purpose of Specification

Specifications serve multiple important purposes in the Rust ecosystem:

- **Clarity**: Define precise semantics and behavior
- **Alternative implementations**: Enable other compilers and tools
- **Teaching**: Help users understand features deeply
- **Reference**: Provide authoritative documentation

## Integration with Development

Specification work should progress alongside implementation, not be deferred until after stabilization.

### Timeline

- **Experimental**: Informal specification or design notes
- **Unstable**: Draft specification covering implemented features
- **Stabilizing**: Comprehensive specification under review
- **Stable**: Complete, reviewed specification

## Specification Requirements

Before stabilization, features should have:

- Precise semantic definitions
- Complete coverage of all behaviors
- Examples and test cases
- Integration with existing language features
- Review by specification team

## Collaboration

Effective specification work requires collaboration between:

- Feature authors who understand the design intent
- Implementers who know the practical details
- Specification writers who can express semantics precisely
- Reviewers who ensure completeness and accuracy
